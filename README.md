# MLP 
In this project, I worked with the Iris dataset, utilizing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify three different types of flowers. I employed TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries and performed data cleaning using normalization techniques. Additionally, I used the LIME library for local interpretable model-agnostic explanations to gain insights into the black box model.
Results: To identify the best model, I employed grid search to find optimal hyperparameters for my MLP model. I visualized the training process by plotting accuracy and loss curves, which helped monitor the results. Achieving a 0.96 accuracy on the test dataset was a significant accomplishment, indicating that the model was not overfitting. This high accuracy on unseen data ensures its applicability in real-world scenarios, allowing for deployment and continuous monitoring to adapt to changing data patterns.
